# Harry Potter - The Board Game

## Primary Goals of Design

- Thematic: Playing HPBG should feel close to the main theme and elements of the book without requiring the same story line. Students, teachers, locations, items, and progression through 6 years of Hogwarts, should all be included, but the actual story line is dynamic and new to the game. Playing a student should feel thematic and appropriate for that character.

- Discovery: Exploring the board should feel like the first years at Hogwarts; discovery rooms, uncovering mysteries to a story, competing in challenges, and completing objectives.

- Expandable: Throwing every single HP trope into a single board game is going to be a failure of complexity. The initial available objectives should stick to the first movie, making it easy to cut out all the loved parts of the book; knowing they can be added in later expansions.

## Game Overview

Harry Potter Boardgame is a semi-cooperative board game where 2 - 8 players, join the Wizarding world playing as either a heroic or villainous student, completing objectives for their house, earning points to win the game; while destroying Lord Voldemort or Professor Dumbledoor can quickly determine the winning team. Players decide to play as either a heroic or villainous student at Hogwarts. 2-8 players can play as long as there is at least 1 player per side and up to 4 per side.
