# Playing the Game

## The Golden Rules

- Rules on cards override rules in this manual.
- If it doesn't say you can, you can not.
- If it says you may, it is optional.
- If it says you must, it is not optional.

### Beginning the Game

### Winning the Game

#### Game Timer

There is a round game tracker that goes in a circle that says what each person can do on a turn
The inner track is year 1 with limited actions, while the progressive outer tracks represent the other 5 years

#### Duel Track

Move the track enough to kill Voldemort or Dumbledoor

Move the house cup up in favor of a house, and the house with the most points wins
