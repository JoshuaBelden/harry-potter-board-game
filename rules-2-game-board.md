# The Board

HPBD is played out on a game board that depicts several locations in Harry Potter including a map of Hogwarts with several rooms. There are also several areas on the board designed to hold game content and components.

## The Houses

In each of the corners of the board is a space depicting one of the 4 houses, Griffendor, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, and Ravenclaw. 

These spaces represent not only the individual houses but serve as common rooms. Anytime a player is instructed to move their character to their House Common Room, they should place their character token on this space.

These corner House spaces are also used to store house point tokens. Whenever your character scores house points, you'll put the tokens on this space.

## Story Track

Along the left side of the board are blank spots reserved for the cards in the chosen story pack. There are 7 places for the Opening Ceremony Story card and the subsequent six Yearly Objective cards.

## Dueling Track

Along the top side is the Dueling Track which represents the force of the hero and villain teams. With Dumbledoor on the right and Voldemort on the left, there are eleven spaces, one center starting position, 4 positions in between Dumbledore and Voldemort and a final position on each of them. If the position track ever lands on either Dumbledore or Voldemort, the game ends immediately and vitory goes to the side that pushed the track all the way to it's opponent.
