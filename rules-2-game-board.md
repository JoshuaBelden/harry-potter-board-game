# The Board

HPBD is played out on a game board that depicts several locations in Harry Potter including a map of Hogwarts with several rooms. There are also several areas on the board designed to hold game content and components.

## Story Track

Along the left side of the board are blank spots reserved for the cards in the chosen story pack. There are 7 places for the Opening Ceremony Story card and the subsequent six Yearly Objective cards.

## Dueling Track

Along the top side is the Dueling Track which represents the force of the hero and villain teams. With Dumbledoor on the right and Voldemort on the left, there are eleven spaces, one center starting position, 4 positions in between Dumbledore and Voldemort and a final position on each of them. If the position track ever lands on either Dumbledore or Voldemort, the game ends immediately and vitory goes to the side that pushed the track all the way to it's opponent.

## Locations

The game board consists primarily of locations, represented by a square area on the board with the name of the location. Hogwarts is a special location, in that it also contains smaller squares for rooms.

The board also contains blank areas reserved for locations and rooms that are discovered during game play. At the beginning of the game, follow the game setup placing discoverable locations and rooms face down in the appropriate areas, or random if not specified. Whenever a character lands on a discoverable location or remove, flip the location or room tile over to the display side.

### Common Rooms

In each of the corners of the board is a space depicting one of the 4 houses, Griffendor, Hufflepuff, Slytherin, and Ravenclaw. 

These spaces represent not only the individual houses but serve as common rooms. Anytime a player is instructed to move their character to their House Common Room, they should place their character token on this space.

These corner House spaces are also used to store house point tokens. Whenever your character scores house points, you'll put the tokens on this space.
