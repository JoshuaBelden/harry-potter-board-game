# Story Packs

Story Packs are the driving force behind HPBG. While the game itself is a platform with mechanics and rules, the story flushes out what each team is trying to do to win the game.

Each story pack includes the following:

- Game Setup card: Describes what components to include in the game for this story pack, including locations, rooms, items, challenges, and npcs.
- An Opening Ceremony speech by Dumbledore that describes the overall objective of the story and how to win the game. The card may contain information that is team specific. Only that team may look at the information. Some of the setup may need to be performed in secret by a particular team.
- 6 Objective cards that describe how to gain story points for each year at Hogwarts. As each new year starts, a new objective card is revealed and read aloud.
- Additional components that are required by the story.

Before the game begins, all players need to decide on a story to use. Each story is neutral and describes how either side, Hero or Villain, can win.

The game comes with 3 story packs that players can enjoy one at a time. The beginning Story Packs that come with the board game are to be played in order, building on the previous packs contents.

## Objectives

At the beginning of each year, a new objective is revealed, describing any events, the current objectives each team needs to achieve and how many story points achieving the objective is worth. Some objectives can be achieved at any point during the current year while others are achieved when the year is over.

Any objective that has been achieved or claimed will gain the team story points. Any story points that are won are placed on the team side that one the points. Any other rewards are collected at the end of the year.

At the end of the 6th year, story points for each team are added up and the team with the most story points is the winner.
